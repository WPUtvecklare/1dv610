# Job Finder

This application has been developed during the course 1DV610 and is based on a login system and a portal for finding jobs. It is written according to the MVC principle in PHP.

The login system provides the ability to login and register. It has 96 % completion of 33 [automated tests](http://csquiz.lnu.se:25083/index.php).

The Job Finder portal allows users to search for jobs in Sweden based on `keyword` and `city`. Currently, the results are obtained from the [Swedish public employment service](https://arbetsformedlingen.se/).
